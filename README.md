# noticen

I made this project to have control of notification sounds in one place.

You can also add more types of notifications in the "switch/case" of the main script.

## Udev rules

In this project are several files that you can take as an example. Always remember to call the script as follows:

    /bin/su -l youruser '/path/to/noticen -x y'
    /bin/su -l youruser 'noticen -x y' # if noticen is on PATH

## Network manager dispatcher
